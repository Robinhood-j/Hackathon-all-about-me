    <h2>Spiritual Foundation</h2>

      My journey is deeply rooted in faith, prayer, and purpose. I believe that every step forward is guided by divine provision and grace.

    <blockquote>
      <em>‚ÄúThe poor and needy search for water, but there is none; their tongues are parched with thirst. But I the Lord will answer them; I, the God of Israel, will not forsake them. I will make rivers flow on barren heights, and springs within the valleys. I will turn the desert into pools of water, and the parched ground into flowing springs.‚Äù</em>
      <br>‚Äî <strong>Isaiah 41:17‚Äì18</strong>

    <h2>Educational Background</h2>
    <p>
      I studied at <strong>Chuka University</strong>, where I earned both a <strong>Certificate</strong> and <strong>Diploma in Computer Science</strong>. My academic journey laid the foundation for my passion in technology and innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond academics, I specialize in writing <strong>business proposals</strong> that are software engineering-oriented ‚Äî blending strategic thinking with real-world impact. My proposals are rooted in community needs and designed to inspire scalable digital solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I may not yet have an extensive software engineering skill set, I carry the <em>backend of the reality</em>: the vision, the logic, and the drive to see these businesses come to life. What I need are collaborators ‚Äî developers who carry the code ‚Äî to help turn these ideas into working platforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I believe in the power of <strong>mentorship</strong>, especially through programs like <strong>PLP</strong>, to bridge the gap between vision and execution. The future I see is one where these businesses become a reality, built through faith, teamwork, and purpose-driven innovation.
